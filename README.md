# Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words 

Dataset was provided by the University Of California, Irvine, Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems. It was retrieved from UCI's Machine Learning Repository.

The data contains census income dataset regarding whether Americans living in the US make over %50k/yr or below its. It contains the age, workclass, education, marital-status, occupation, op-inspect, relationship, race, sex, capital-gain loss, hours-per week, and native country of birth. 

The purpose of the data set is to analyze the most important attributes in determining whether someone will make over $50k/yr based on census data.

The data was donated by an outside group for the UCI, Machine Learning Repository. It was donated by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker of the Data Miniming and Visualization department of Silicon Graphics on 1996-05-1. The data depository does not provide the methods used to collect the data. 

# Describe your topic/interest in this dataset - answer in about 150-200 words

My interest in the dataset lies in whether the potential for an individual to make $50k is based off factors within his or her control. Factors that cannot be controlled such as the race, sex, and native country of birth would have a bigger or lesser impact on their income compared to factors that an individual can control such as their education, occupation, and work class. 

This dataset can measure the degree of control an individual can exercise over his or her potential lifelong income depending on the circumstances of their birth that cannot be changed. In contrast to factors an individual can decide such as the level of education, choice of occupation, and the type of working class environment.
